Bachelor's Thesis
SAT solver algorithms with graphical interface

In this thesis, I have implemented three algorithms: CDCL, DPLL, and WalkSAT, for solving the satisfiability problem, and I have created a graphical interface
that visually demonstrates, step by step, the functioning of the algorithms for any given instance.

To develop the graphical interface, I utilized the Kivy library in Python.
