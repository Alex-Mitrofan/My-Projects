CDCL

UNIT PROPAGATION: If an unsatisfied clause has all but one of its literals or variables evaluated at False,
then the free literal must be True in order for the clause to be True. For example, if the below unsatisfied
clause is evaluated with A=False and B=False we must have C=True n order for the clause (A v B v C)  to be true.

On the left half of the screen there is the Decision Tree, and on the right part there is the Implication Graph.

In Decision Tree a blue arrow means the level where CDCL back jumps.

In Implication Graph a red edge means an edge that lead to a conflict and must be cut.


DPLL

A GREEN node in decision tree means that formula is SAT following that path, and a RED circle means that formula
is unsatisfiable.

Final solution for formula may include nodes colored in black (default color). That means that those nodes could
be either True or False and the final formula will be satisfiable.

WalkSAT

The nodes in graph represent each variable, and there is an edge between two nodes if the nodes are in the same 
clause.
A node is colored GREEN if the variable inside it was assigned True value, and it is colored RED if the variable 
was assigned False value.
